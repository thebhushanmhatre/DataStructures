// Minimum platforms required at a railway station so that no train is kept waiting

let n = 6;
let arrival = [0900, 0940, 0950, 1100, 1500, 1800];
let departure = [0910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000];

// // example 2
// let n = 3
// let arrival = [0900, 1100, 1235]
// let departure = [1000, 1200, 1240]
