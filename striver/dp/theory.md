Shortcuts as he says

1. Try to represent in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuff on that index according to the problem statement
3. Sum of all stuffs => if Qn: Count All ways
   Min if qn

Recursion => Memoization => Tabulation => Space optimization

Optimize recursion by using Memoization

Tabulation: Converting Recursion to a loop

Space Optimization: Instead of storing entire array, just store the last indexes in a variable(s)ff

# Convert Recursion to Tabulation Steps

1. Declare base case
2. Express all states in for loops
3. Copy the recurrence and write

Recursion is called Top down - go down towards the base case
Tabultaion is called bottoms up - start from base case

# Dp on Grids / 2D matrix

Count Paths
Count Paths with obstacles
Min Path sum
Max Path sum
Triangle
2 start points
